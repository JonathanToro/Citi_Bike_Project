# Exploring the Citibike Data

## Project that analyzes and predicts the daily use of the citibike program in NYC.

I decided to do this project just for fun because I'm an avid user of the citibike program in NYC. The code provided in this repo displays the discoveries I made from analyziing the citibike data. I scraped weather data from the web to add more features to the model for when I attempted to predict the daily use of citibike.

Please refer to [my blog][1] for details.
